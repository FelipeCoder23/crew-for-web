1. **Handling Industry-Specific Data:**
   - **Question:** Describe a situation where you had to analyze a complex dataset from an EHR system to improve patient outcomes. What methodologies did you use, and what insights were you able to derive from your analysis?
   - **Outcome Described:** The candidate should demonstrate their ability to tackle large datasets, utilizing relevant statistical methods and tools like SQL or Python libraries. Insights gained should include actionable recommendations that might lead to improved treatment efficiencies or patient engagement strategies.

2. **Technical Scenarios for the Role:**
   - **Question:** Imagine you are tasked with developing a new mobile application for telehealth services. What steps would you take from conception to deployment, and how would you ensure user privacy and regulatory compliance during this process?
   - **Outcome Described:** The candidate should outline a comprehensive approach including requirements gathering, wireframing, development, testing, and deployment. Emphasis on HIPAA compliance and patient data security measures, such as encryption and access controls, would demonstrate their understanding of regulatory frameworks.

3. **Questions about Core Skills:**
   - **Question:** In the context of predictive analytics for patient care, can you explain how you would utilize machine learning algorithms to identify at-risk patients and recommend preventative measures?
   - **Outcome Described:** Candidates should illustrate their understanding of machine learning principles and techniques. They should discuss the selection of relevant features, potential algorithms to use (like decision trees or logistic regression), and how outcomes would be validated to ensure efficacy in the recommendations provided.

4. **Industry-Specific Challenges:**
   - **Question:** How would you approach integrating AI tools into existing telehealth services while addressing potential pushback from both staff and patients who may be skeptical of technology?
   - **Outcome Described:** The response should include strategies to communicate the benefits of AI, the importance of staff education, and demonstrations of the technology in practice to build trust. Candidates should highlight the relevance of user feedback in continuously improving these tools to meet stakeholder concerns.

By responding to these questions effectively, candidates will exhibit their mastery of the core skills necessary for their roles within the healthcare industry, particularly in the context of a telehealth-focused company. This will demonstrate their capability to navigate both technical and regulatory landscapes while focusing on enhancing patient outcomes through innovative technologies.
